The past cannot predict the future  
That is why we have no flying cars  
Nor terraformed mars  
Though robots may be near  
  
Many paths are always present  
More paths created, more possibilities  
Yet all paths must lead somewhere  
Unless you forget the final

I very much so focused on parts of what I read instead of what I feel some of the main messages were,  
but I also hate writing poetry, so this is the extent of what I can do.  
It was very satisfying learning some of this stuff.
